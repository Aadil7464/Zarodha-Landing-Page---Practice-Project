# Zarodha-Landing-Page---Practice-Project
This is a simple clone of the landing page of Zerodha, one of India's leading investment platforms. It is built using only HTML and inline CSS.
The main purpose of this project is to practice HTML structure and inline CSS styling without using external CSS files. By writing style attributes directly within HTML tags, I focused on revising core CSS properties like layout, spacing, color, alignment, and font styling.

This hands-on approach helps improve muscle memory and makes it easier to remember CSS properties without switching between files.

 What I Learned:
How to structure a professional-looking landing page

Applying flexbox using inline styles for layout

Using spacing (margin, padding) and alignment properties effectively

Practicing image placement, buttons, headers, and text formatting

Importance of clean and readable code

Technologies Used:
HTML5

Inline CSS only (no external stylesheets)
